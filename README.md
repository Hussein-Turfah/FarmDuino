<!-- Tech stack -->
<img src="./readme/title5.svg"/>

###  FarmDuino is built using the following technologies:

- The project uses [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), a microcontroller platform, to collect and process data from various sensors installed in the farm.
- The frontend of the application is built using [React JS](https://react.dev/), a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Electron JS](https://www.electronjs.org/) is used to develop a desktop application that can be installed and used on different operating systems.
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) is used to develop the backend of the application. Laravel is a PHP framework that allows us to build web applications quickly and efficiently.
- [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) font is used as the main font throughout the application.

> To set up FarmDuino locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your computer:

   - Composer
   - npm (Node Package Manager)
   - PHP
   - MySQL
   - Node.js


### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Get a free API Key at [OPENAI](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api) and at [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone   https://github.com/Hussein-Turfah/FarmDuino.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages inside the `desktop` folder
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Install Composer packages inside the `server` folder
   ```sh
   composer install
   ```
5. Migrate the database from inside the `server` folder 
   ```sh
   php artisan migrate
   ```
6. Enter your API in `.example.env` and rename it to `.env`
   ```js
   OPENAI_API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API'
   WEATHER_API_KEY='ENTER YOUR API'
   TREFLE_API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```

Now, you should be able to run FarmDuino locally and explore its features ðŸ¤©.
