###  FarmDuino is built using the following technologies:

- The project utilizes [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), a versatile microcontroller platform, to collect and analyze data from various farm sensors and control interconnected actuators.
- The project's backend utilizes the power of [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), a robust PHP framework renowned for its rapid and efficient web application development capabilities. 
- The application's frontend is crafted with [React.js](https://react.dev/), a widely adopted JavaScript library specifically designed for creating dynamic and engaging user interfaces.
- We leverage [Electron.js](https://www.electronjs.org/) to build a versatile desktop application that seamlessly runs on multiple operating systems, providing users with a consistent experience across platforms.
- We utilize the [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)  font as the primary typeface across the entire application, ensuring a clean and modern visual aesthetic.

<!-- How to run -->
<img src="./readme/title6.svg"/>

> To set up FarmDuino locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

To ensure the smooth functioning of your FarmDuino app, please make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your computer:

- PHP: Required for running the FarmDuino app built with the Laravel framework.
- Composer: A dependency manager for PHP used by Laravel and required for managing Laravel's dependencies.
- Node.js: A runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser and required for running ReactJS components in Electron.
- npm (Node Package Manager): A package manager for Node.js used by ReactJS components in Electron and required for managing ReactJS dependencies.
- Arduino IDE: An integrated development environment for Arduino used for programming the Arduino microcontroller and flashing the written code to it.
- MySQL: Database management system used by Laravel for data storage and retrieval.

By having these prerequisites installed and configured correctly, you will be ready to develop and run the FarmDuino app with its various components seamlessly.
